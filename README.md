# Angular Personnal Website

This is a version of my personnal website that divides more properly the Front-end and Back-end.

## Project structure
Everything in the /API folder is related to the API linking the front-end to the SQLite database. The only file present at the moment is the python script used to create the API (api.py). 

Files in the /DB folder are related to the SQLite database. Currently the only files present are the database itself named 'web.db' and a python script used for updating it every hour (DB.py).

The /Web_Application folder is the Angular web application running the front end of the web site

## How to run (WIP)

## Tech used (WIP)
**Front-end**  
Angular  

**Back-end**  
SQLite 3  
Python  

## Goal
My goal with this website is to make me able to expand my website in the future without rewriting everything at once as well as provide a way to link multiple web applications that I create together.
